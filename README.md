# GreenIbague_Dash_Flask

### Background

This project was carried out as a degree requirement for the Data Science for All (DS4A) program offered by Correlation One and the Ministry of Technology and Information of Colombia. We worked together with staff from the Ibagué mayor's office to finalize this web page.

It is intended to provide information on the trees of Ibagué and its states by analyzing the information obtained from censuses carried out between 2014 and 2017 by the Ministry of Environment and Risk Management. The data from these censuses are published in Public Data of Ibagué.
